## üí° Use Cases

### üè´ School Safety & Access Control

* Authorized personnel access control
* Emergency response notifications 
  
### üöî City & Law Enforcement

* Deployable on poles, rooftops, or vehicles with counter support integration
* Shareable URLs, instant camera mesh, scalable from a classroom to an entire city
* Gimbal kits with 10 - 50x zoom, visual identification, and sound triangulation

## üîé Airfield Surveillance & Air Traffic Observation
* Monitor runways, taxiways, and apron areas with extreme detail, day or night
* Detect unauthorized access, wildlife, debris, or erratic vehicle/aircraft behavior
* Provides a secondary, visual verification layer alongside ADS-B and MLAT
* Track and classify aircraft or drones that do not emit transponder signals

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance
* Privacy First: No facial recognition, biometric tagging, or individual tracking
* On-Device Processing: All data remains local with no third-party transfer
* Strict Escalation Protocols: Tracking requires authorized escalation
* Incident Focused AI: Limited to detecting patterns not persons (e.g., visible weapons, dangerous vehicle behavior, or hazardous events)
* Controlled Access: Monitoring or evidence retrieval is bound to legal and compliance frameworks, ensuring civil liberties remain protected
* Transparency & Auditability: Systems are auditable to guarantee adherence to privacy, safety, and lawful usage standards
